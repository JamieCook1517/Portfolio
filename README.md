## Installation

Copy the link of this repo then type **git clone _repo link_** into your terminal. The folder will then be downloaded to your current working directory.

## Usage

I highly recommend that you use Visual Studio Code to run the projects beacuse that is what I used in making them. (You never know what unwanted trickery might happen in the compatability with the projects by a different IDE.)

Here are some explanations of usage for each of the following projects *(in chronological order)*.

### CareerCrafter

A basic program which asks you to type in your name, surname, age, email adress and phone number and then summarises them. Nothing much else to say about it. It is meant to be a work which shows defensive error-handling skills.
